# User Form

### What is this?

- This is a responsive validated form built using React and CSS utilising Formik, Yup and React Confetti.
- This project skips CRA and uses a custom implementation instead.

### Quickstart

- Clone this repo to your local machine.
- In command line, run: `npm install`.
- Then run: `npm run dev`.
- Then navigate to the localhost where the server is running as indicated in your command line.
- Note: Use the last two versions of chrome or firefox as the browser. See comment in App.js line 16-20 for more information.
